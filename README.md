# IRC_Drug_Dealer
IRC Drug Dealing Bot

This bot is an IRC game that allows you to buy and sell drugs, and saves your score.

I plan to add more features in the future, but for now, here are the commands:

.buy [amount] [drug]/n
.sell [amount] [drug]
.check [drug OR 'money']

Currently there are 3 drugs: heroin, meth, and cocaine

All players start out with 10 of each drug, and 500 cash. This can be changed by editing the main .py file. You may also change the bot's nick, target channel/network, and identification settings by scrolling down to the IRC section and changing the variables. I recommend leaving this bot in a seperate directory/folder because the amount of .dat files can get pretty big.
